    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) has been the leading programming paradigm for several decades now, starting from the initial attempts back in the 60s to some of the most important languages used nowadays. Being a set of programming concepts and design methodologies, OOP can never be said to be \"correctly\" or \"fully\" implemented by a language: indeed there are as many implementations as languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "So one of the most interesting aspects of OOP languages is to understand how they implement those concepts. In this post I am going to try and start analyzing the OOP implementation of the Python language. Due to the richness of the topic, however, I consider this attempt just like a set of thoughts for Python beginners trying to find their way into this beautiful (and sometimes peculiar) language.\n",
    "\n",
    "This series of posts wants to introduce the reader to the Python 3 implementation of Object Oriented Programming concepts. The content of this and the following posts will not be completely different from that of the previous \"OOP Concepts in Python 2.x\" series, however. The reason is that while some of the internal structures change a lot, the global philosophy doesn't, being Python 3 an _evolution_ of Python 2 and not a new language.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I chose to split the previous series and to adapt the content to Python 3 instead of posting a mere list of corrections. I find this way to be more useful for new readers, that otherwise sould be forced to read the previous series.\n",

    "Computer science deals with data and with procedures to manipulate that data. Everything, from the earliest Fortran programs to the latest mobile apps is about data and their manipulation. \n",

I'm still opening a door, the action is the same, and it just changes the status of the door itself.

    "\n",
    "The structural meaning identifies the type of something by looking at its internal structure. So two things that act in the same way but are internally different are of different type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both points of view can be valid, and different languages may implement and emphasize one meaning of type or the other, and even both.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Games\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects in Python may be built describing their structure through a _class_. A class is the programming representation of a generic object, such as \"a book\", \"a car\", \"a door\": when I talk about \"a door\" everyone can understand what I'm saying, without the need of referring to a specific door in the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the type of an object is represented by the class used to build the object: that is, in Python the word _type_ has the same meaning of the word _class_.\n",
